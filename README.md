CS61C-projects
==============

contains code for CS61C - Machine Structures projects from UC Berkeley. much of the existing code was given 
by the instructional staff.

Notes:

project 1 (http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa13/proj/01/):

I initially used a nested ArrayList (an ArrayList of ArrayLists).  For part 2 of the project, I realized this
was very slow, so I switched to using the Java built-in HashMap.  

project 2 (http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa13/proj/02/):

Part 1 of this project contains imperfections - some cases are missing necessary casts for sign extension.
Part 2 contains my fixes for part 1, and I received full credit for this part of the project.

project 3
