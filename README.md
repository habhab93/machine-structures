machine structures course
==============

contains code for Machine Structures course projects from UC Berkeley. much of the existing code was given 
by the instructional staff.

Notes:

project 1 (http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa13/proj/01/):

consists of DoublePair.java and Proj1.java
I initially used a nested ArrayList (an ArrayList of ArrayLists).  For part 2 of the project, I realized this
was very slow, so I switched to using the Java built-in HashMap.  The commented code contains my initial submission for
part 1.

Took about 10 hours.

project 2 (http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa13/proj/02/):

consists of proj1.c and proj2.c

types.h contains the given data types we were able to work with

Part 1 of this project contains imperfections - some cases are missing necessary casts for sign extension.
Part 2 contains my fixes for part 1, and I received full credit for this part of the project.

Took about 10 hours.

project 3 (http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa13/proj/03/):

Part 1 of this project: memory allocation and SSE instructions made the biggest increases in gigaflops for the project.

Part 2 of this project: using openMP and privatizing variables to be used efficiently to further increase gigaflops.

Took about 8 hours; completed with Puneet Dewan.

project 4 (http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/fa13/proj/04/):

Completed in Logisim. Consists of Regfile.circ, alu.circ, cpu.circ.

Took about 20-25 hours.
